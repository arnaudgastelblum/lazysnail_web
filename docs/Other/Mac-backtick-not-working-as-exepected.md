# Backtick key doesn't work like expecting on my macbook

Since I switch my PC on windows to a macbook, I had some problem with the backtick caracter.

## Writing code in Teams didn't work

## Writing some caracters after give me an accentuated caracter

`a` `e` `u` `i` `o`

`à` `è` `ù` `ì` `ò`

## Can't have a pair of the first caracters

I had to press manually two times the key and I had some weird behavior when I wanted a code block (6 backtip)

```
Like this block of code
```


# The solution

To fix this I installed a software named `Ukelele`

## Installation

### From `brew`
For those who use brew, use this command `brew install Ukelele`

### From their website
[https://software.sil.org/ukelele/](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/)


## Method

Follow the steps

Open `Ukelele`
