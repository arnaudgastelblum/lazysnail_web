<h2 id="why-this-list">Why this list?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today, I had some time to learn!<br />I think I'm not that bad for <strong>data modeling, T-SQL, SQL server performance, Power Query, DAX, coaching and understanding user requirements</strong>. (Yes, sometimes it's very good to <strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">be kind to yourself</mark></strong> :) )</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But putting effort into many different techs skills, I should mention it to the whole world (at least you, because you are reading my blog post).</p>

## Table and Matrix fan


<p>You will maybe recognize you in my description! I'm the kind of guy who uses Table and Matrix a lot. For testing and understanding my data!<br />Matrix is wonderful! You can look at the behavior of your measures at the different grain in one minute! List, Sub Total, Total!! Amazing!</p>


<h2 id="i-can-t-stop-my-crazy-pleasure-to-click-on-all-that-kind-of-visuals">I can't stop my crazy pleasure to click on all that kind of visuals</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":5178,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="../../assets/2022/02/image-6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5178" /></figure>
</div>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I'm proud of it, I try to build a visual useful for my users. So I transform this table into a graphic. I click the first button, then I change for the second and I can't stop my crazy pleasure to click on all that kind of visuals!!<br />But do I know what I'm choosing? NO!<br />I knew, yes.. But right now, I'm just clicking to find the best one who will give me the satisfaction between 2 tasty coffees. (And yes, Power BI is also a question of feeling and pleasure. Like a very addictive game)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the image on top, I tested all these graphics and keep a trace of them. First, to help me the next time I need to pick the right one. (And I hope, it can help you too)</p>

<p>Next step? I still need to learn more about visualization! And I will!<br />And you, do you click everywhere until you have the best one? If no, how did you become data artist / story teller?</p>
