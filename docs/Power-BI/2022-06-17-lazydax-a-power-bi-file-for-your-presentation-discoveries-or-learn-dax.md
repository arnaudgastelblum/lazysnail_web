## It contains:

 **DAX**: I organized multiple Measure in the same way Microsoft present all the DAX functions in their folders. It was an efficient way for me to test it all.
 
 **Visuals**: On different pages, I used all the existing visuals, and tried to provide you some ideas to build a more fancy report.


## Test it here

## Why

I spent a lot of my free time on it, and in this new version I changed the look n'feel and try a dark mode report. (Yes, it's also a playground for me to test Power BI)
I created it more than 4 years ago now, but I still use it every week. (If not every day)
I can use it for my presentation, and help people with DAX. I hope it can help you too, and would really enjoy hearing your thoughts, ideas and requests.
