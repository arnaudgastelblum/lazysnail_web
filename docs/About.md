The journey began when I started mentoring a younger colleague. Over time, I realized I derived immense joy from imparting knowledge and watching him blossom. Even though he was anything but lethargic or slow-moving, I playfully dubbed him `Lazy snail`. That's the inspiration behind the name of my blog and all my pursuits.

## My Journey

Beyond championing the Star Schema, I have an affinity for neatly written code. My Windows desktop is a reflection of that penchant for order. Should I enable icons, the lone one you'd find is the recycle bin.

From diverse programming languages to the realm of Business Intelligence, life has taken me on an intriguing path.

I'm often asked: **Did I stray too far from my roots?**

Actually, I haven't! Databases, SQL Queries, and BI technologies may not follow identical logic but echo similar principles:

    - Maintain clean code
    - Avoid code redundancy
    - Keep complexity at a comprehensible level
    - Prioritize performance
    - Always keep users in mind

Given these beliefs, I proudly identify as a **BI developer**!

## A Glimpse into My Personal Life

Although it may sound unusual, my job is my passion! If it's not yours, perhaps **Power BI** might change your perspective.

Life blessed me with two kids: Pauline and Antoine. They're my greatest joys and challenges rolled into one. Fellow parents might resonate with this sentiment.

Running is another passion of mine. The camaraderie in the running community is unparalleled. Having completed multiple Marathons and Half Marathons, the thrill for me lies in challenging myself and relishing the moment I cross the finish line.
