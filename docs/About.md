# Hey you want to know who I am?

With Lazysnail, I wanted to create a place where I can find my toolbox and share my discoveries around Microsoft BI technologies and geek stuff.

{: .note :}
A few years ago, I started to share my knowledge with a young colleague. Day after day, I understood that I had more pleasure to explain and see his crazy improvement instead of doing by myself. This guy was not Lazy and slow like a snail, but I gave him this little nickname `Lazy snail`. This how I took the name for my blog and all my activities. 


## What's the story?

I’m not only a Star Schema defender, but I also love when code is well aligned. My Windows desktop is clean, and if I don’t disable desktop icons, then you can only see my recycle bin icon.

I have a strong developer background in multiple (funny or not) languages. Life has led me from code to the Business Intelligence world.

Often, I still have to answer this question: **Why did I go so far and denial my own nature?**

Well, it’s not so far! Databases, SQL Queries, BI technologies don’t share the same logic but definitely the same patterns.

```
    Clean your code
    Do not repeat your code
    Keep complexity understandable
    Think about performance
    Do not forget your users
```

Anyway, for all of these reasons, I’m a **BI developer**!


## and my life?

I’m strange, but my passion is my job! Not you?? Then you should give a try to **Power BI**!

I have 2 kids: Pauline and Antoine who are the best and the worst things in my life. Dear parents, do you understand my thoughts?

I like running and all the sharing moments you can have in this community. I did multiple Marathon and Half Marathon, my pleasure is to fight myself and cross the finish line.
