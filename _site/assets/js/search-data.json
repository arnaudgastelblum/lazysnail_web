    "content": "As you know, the August 2018 update of Power BI Desktop grants us the possibility to export in PDF directly from the Desktop. Two clicks and it's done. Great news right? I remember all the steps I had to go through to make it before, it still give me headache... But by default, the report will be exported with the standard format of Power BI Desktop which can be for some end users or clients not very pleasant to read especially if they are used to an A4 page. The real question is then, how to export in that specific format? Here is the answer. First, let's take our wonderful LazyDAX file and create a new page. Here is the default view you have when adding a new page. Nothing special until there. What's interesting is the \"Page View\" button under the \"View\" tab. Once we click on it, we can select \"Actual Size\". By choosing \"Actual Size\" we will see the \"real\" size of the page, based on its dimensions. Now we can see that the page size exceed the usual limit of the report. But we want to make it like a A4 portrait page right? So, we are not done yet. You can select the \"Format\" pane of the report page, then \"Page Size\" and select \"Custom\" as \"Type\".&nbsp; Now, we just have to enter the custom size we want. I chose 794*1123 pixels because it is the A4 size at 96 PPI (depending of the printing, you can find more info about it here). Now we have our A4 report page ready to be filled. As you can see, there is now a scroll bar on the right side of the report because of the dimension of the page. We now just have to export as PDF and that's it. You can click on the \"File\" button and then choose \"Export to PDF\". You now just have to let Power BI make the work and here is the result. The last report page is well in portrait format, while the others have been exported in the default format. As you can see, there is nothing really difficult here but you just have to be aware of it. &nbsp; . ",

(Data Modelling is not the subject here) Power BI a super tool? Yes, and to complete this idea, I added some slides to highlight each piece of the tool. One of the slides showed the ease and elegance of the visuals. After a quick search on Google images, I copied a screenshot created by a user in Power BI and added it to my presentation. In the audience, two friends looked at me with a horrible face. The damage was done, I had slipped the image of a Pie Chart! . Nothing crazy, isn't it? But when you know a bit of the history of the Pie Chart, we realize that this visual component is not recommended in the world of Data Viz. This blog post also follows some more or less tense discussions between colleagues. I wrote this article for many reasons: . This point is already super documented on internet but some people never read them before. (I provide links at the end) I wanted to convinced myself first, and created a Power BI file to confirm this point. (CFR the following screenshot) . ",

This is not always the case, but it’s quite often what I saw. Several positive points to this: . | Speed ​​of implementation | The size of the model reduced to the report need (Small size). | It does the work!! | .

The next two topics require the first change in your habits. Do not keep the source tables as they are in your model When you load your data into Power BI, you can make several changes in the Query Builder. In addition to data typing, conditions, it is essential to consolidate the data. This is the perfect introduction for Denormalization. ",

    "title": "Denormalization",
    "content": "Normalization / Denormalization ? . In computer science, we tend to standardize information. An example will be more concrete than a definition: A product is available with a color. A Color entity will be created and will contain all available colors. In the source system, a drop-down list allow the user to pick up a color. Often the main table retains a key (foreign key) that references the other table. This way of exploding the model into multiple tables is called “normalization”. For our reporting needs, we have to backtrack and consolidate information into fewer tables. If we denormalize, our example could looks like this simple table. | Simple for your users | Simple for your model | Simple for your DAX measures | . Concrete example . In this example, Bill tooks all the tables and files from his source system. He decided to load the table as is, without any changes. It was easy for him and he knows very well his model. But his users came back to him with a ton of question regarding interactions. Which tables will be impacted if they filter one specific attribute. They were not really sure. Since they have the “Sales Person” in their model, they wanted to know if Gender or Marital Status were link to “Sales Person” or “Client”. (So bill, renamed it to make it clear) . One day Bill wakes up with a giant smile! Is it because his favorite TV show is scheduled today? Not only! He has an idea… And a straightforward one.He decided to group his data into fewer tables. (When there is no many to many relationships).His work life changes to better! . | Less complex DAX expression | More understandable datasets | Less support and more time to watch his TV show. (Yes, both are compatible!) | . ",

    "title": "Brainstorming",
    "content": "The title should perhaps have been: Do not keep the focus on the technical problems but think of yourself. We all tend to want technical challenges, it’s addictive, and it gives us the impression of moving forward! In our Professional world, Power BI is the equivalent of Candy Crush! But I have more pleasure in aligning beautiful DAX measures in a table than sweets, do not you? For this point, I invite you to step back and step against our technical world. Ask yourself the following questions: (or ask them to your users) . | What is the nature of your work? Describe it to me. | What are you doing within the company? | What indicators and reports do you consult? | . Take note of the information in the form of keywords and mention the frequency. Some words will stand out and can be likened to what we will call later “Dimensions”. My advice: Take a pen, paper, coffee, soft music. Disconnect from your computers, technical “worries”. Make sure your explanations can be understood by your wife, your husband, your friends, your sports coach, your children … and yourself … . Your notes could look like this word cloud. See if some words do not relate to each other through an idea or logic. For example,[Customer Code] and [Customer Name] could be grouped under the same “Customer” dimension. (While these are potentially in two different tables or source files) The watchword here is: DO NOT THINK TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS. Without knowing it, you imagine the data model dreamed for you and your users. It fits your needs, your business, and does not care (yet) about the complexity needed for the data transformation! In this model, an end-user will find it much more comfortable and can even build their reports. Attributes will be displayed, grouped by logical ideas, and will facilitate reporting. The attractiveness of Power BI and BI Self-Service, in general, will not only be available to you, but it will also be accessible to end-users. Now that you’ve sketched out your dimensions, you can link them together. You certainly have information that expresses an event with measurable data. (Additive data) For example: . | A sale with a price, a quantity. | An inscription with a volume, a frequency. | . The relationships mentioned above correspond to Facts. A fact table is defined by its grain, which is itself determined by the list of dimensions attached to it. The sale is made: . | By a customer | For a product | In a store | On a given date | With a means of payment | . The inscription bears: . | On a magazine | By a subscriber | For delivery to a specific address | With a subscription end date | . A brainstorming session can quickly give you a good overview of your next dataset. Your fact table is in the middle and dimensions around. Where is the technical complexity for your users? For your DAX measures? Your users can now keep the focus on their results and to the more complicated question: Do I really avoid to use a Pie Chart ;) You can now look in detail how you will load your dimensions. Dimension by dimension asks you the question: Which is the grain of my dimension? Household, client, client history? And now start your candy crush session, load your data, and play a lot in the query Builder / SQL / … more … And do not forget to enjoy it, our work is exciting! . ",

Obsidian is all about customization and making your note-taking experience, just yours. That’s why it’s such a powerful tool for anyone who takes notes, whether you’re a student, writer, or just someone who likes to write things down. One of the things I love most about Obsidian is how easy it is to write and organize notes. The interface is clean and uncluttered, which makes it easy to focus on what’s important. You can add tags and links to your notes, which makes it super easy to find related content later on. And because Obsidian stores all your notes in Markdown files, you can easily export your notes if you ever decide to switch to another software. ",

My daily notes, my project note, I’m rewriting note in a more readable format. First, it gives me an impression of control, which it’s already very cool.

Life has led me from code to the Business Intelligence world. Often, I still have to answer this question: Why did I go so far and denial my own nature? . Well, it’s not so far! Databases, SQL Queries, BI technologies don’t share the same logic but definitely the same patterns. Clean your code Do not repeat your code Keep complexity understandable Think about performance Do not forget your users . Anyway, for all of these reasons, I’m a BI developer! . ",
